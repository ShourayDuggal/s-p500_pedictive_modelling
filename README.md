# s-p500_pedictive_modelling
predictive modelling using only linear models (external constraints on accepted solutions)

The goal of the exercise was to forecast excess s&p 500 monhly returns using Macroeconomic and fixed-income monthly market data and trade based on the forecast. With an external constraint to use only linear models.

I have made a dynamic model on a simplistic assumption that returns are driven by different factors at differnt times and these factors persist in the market for several periods.
